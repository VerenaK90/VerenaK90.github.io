		<p>Verena is a Systems Biologist by training and holds a strong interest in the dynamics governing somatic evolution. In her previous position as postdoc with Paresh Vyas in Oxford, she developed SCIFER, a computational tool to quantify drift and selection in human hematopoiesis. Before that, she worked as a postdoc and PhD student with Thomas Höfer in Heidelberg to quantify the evolutionary dynamics governing malignant transformation and tumor growth in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma.</p>
