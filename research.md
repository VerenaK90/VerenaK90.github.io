			<h2>Our research</h2>

		<p>We are interested in understanding how human somatic tissues renew themselves and how these processes become subverted in diseases such as cancer and as we age. To study this in human, we use the continuous accumulation of somatic variants as molecular barcodes. To this end, we combine next generation sequencing at bulk and single cell resolution with the development of novel mathematical models of division and differentiation dynamics along stem and progenitor cell hierarchies. Leveraging mathematical modelling and bioinformatic analysis of primary human tissue with functional experiments in vitro and in vivo, we aim to comprehensively understand how these fundamental biological processes are molecularly regulated. Hence, we collaborate closely with clinical and experimental partners. Our research chiefly aims to address the following questions:
