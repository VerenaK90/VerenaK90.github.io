		<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher in Mathematical Modelling of Somatic Evolution</h3>
	<p>We are seeking a talented and motivated postdoctoral researcher to join our Somatic Evolution Research group  </p>
	<p>You will contribute to the research of somatic evolution during aging and malignant transformation, taking the lead in developing novel mathematical models and statistical tools, to quantify clonal dynamics in aging and malignant human tissues. As a member of an interdisciplinary team, working closely together with experimental and clinical collaborators, you will devise deterministic and stochastic models of tissue evolution and parametrize them with a wide range of multi-ome data at bulk and single cell resolution.</p>
		<p>You will hold a PhD in Mathematics, Systems Biology or a related subject. Experience with mathematical modelling of dynamical systems using linear and non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations and the proficient use of statistical programming languages (R, Julia or Python), Bash computing and the development of computational packages are essential. Experience with modelling and simulation of stochastic processes, including birth-death processes is also required.</p>
		<p>The post is available fixed-term until 31 March 2027, funded by the Medical Research Council.</p>
		<p>Applications for this vacancy are to be made <a href="https://my.corehr.com/pls/uoxrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.display_form?p_company=10&p_internal_external=E&p_display_in_irish=N&p_process_type=&p_applicant_no=&p_form_profile_detail=&p_display_apply_ind=Y&p_refresh_search=Y&p_recruitment_id=183750"> online</a>. You will be required to upload a CV and supporting statement as part of your online application </p>
	<p><b>The closing date for this position is noon on Friday 02 January 2026. Interviews to be held in January 2026. </b></p>
	<h3>Bachelor/Master students and internships</h3>
			<p>We are always interested in Bachelor students, Master students and interns from biology, computer sciences, mathematics, physics or similar. Please reach out to Verena, explaining in a brief email why you are interested in joining our group and what you would like to do.</p>
