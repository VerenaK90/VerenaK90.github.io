		<h3>Optimizing therapeutic intervention in paediatric myelodysplastic syndrome with mathematical modelling</h3>
	<p>We are currently advertising a DPhil studentship as part of the Oxford DPhil in Cancer Science program. For full information see here: <a href="https://www.cancer.ox.ac.uk/study">https://www.cancer.ox.ac.uk/study</a>. </p>
	<p><i><b>Short project description: </b>Paediatric myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a rare disorder characterised by inefficient haematopoiesis, and a high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). To date, the only cure available is bone marrow transplantation, however timing of therapeutic intervention is challenging due to the highly variable disease course. This DPhil project will develop mechanistic mathematical models of disease evolution to better understand the timescales of malignant transformation and to characterise the dynamics of disease progression in different MDS entities. We will integrate multimodal datasets, including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and epigenetic data, to derive mathematical models of clonal evolution which will form the basis for the first risk stratification algorithm for paediatric MDS. The output of this project will lay the foundation for risk stratification based on clonal evolution, and will aid future therapeutic interventions.</i></p>
